# Inviting NQN

The easiest way to invite the bot is through the NQN website.
Simply visit [https://nqn.blue/invite](https://nqn.blue/invite) and choose your server. 

If you don't have all the permissions NQN requires, don't worry.
When it joins, it'll send a DM to the server owner with a new invite link, but only if it detects it's missing permissions.

Once you've added NQN to your server, you can use it with no additional setup. If you want to customise your server's experience, see [Basic configuration](settings.md).

On the post-invite screen, click 'View your server' to view any permissions issues that might be present in your server.
This can be accessed at any time through the bot dashboard by clicking on the 'Dashboard' button in the navbar, selecting your server, clicking on the settings cog in the sidebar, and then choosing the 'Permissions' tab.
