# Personas

NQN can allow users to repost messages with custom usernames and avatars. 

To help moderation when this feature is enabled, NQN has an audit channel setting, which posts the original author whenever a message is posted via the bot. 

To enable the audit channel, run `/server audit_channel` command, and select the channel you want NQN to post audit message in. 

If you want to see the author of a specific message, you can right click it, go to 'Apps', and then 'Find Author'.
