# Personas

NQN can allow users to repost messages with custom usernames and avatars. 
Given the potential for abuse, this feature is disabled by default. 

A server moderator might wish to use this tool to post as their 'server' by creating a persona for it, and setting the username and avatar to that of the server's.

### Moderating Personas:

Since this usage can be used to impersonate others, we recommend having a look at the following links before enabling this feature:


- [Auditing messages](moderation/auditing.md)
- [Guild settings](settings.md)

Using the tools NQN provides, you will be easily able to see who posts messages, and perform moderation actions.
