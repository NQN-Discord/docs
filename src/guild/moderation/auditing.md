# Auditing messages

Sometimes people post undesirable content with NQN. 
To help combat this, NQN provides functionality to see who posted a given message. 
This can be achieved by right-clicking on the message, going to 'Apps', and then 'Find Author'.

To quickly kick or ban the user who posted a message with NQN, you can use Discord's reply feature with the message `!mod kick` or `!mod ban`.
If you need to remove all the messages posted with NQN, the `!mod purge` command allows this, optionally allowing you to filter by the target user.

To see the messages a user has posted with NQN, right-click on their profile, go to 'Apps' and then 'Audit NQN Messages'.
