# Emoji Statistics

NQN provides usage statistics for all your emojis in your server. 

To check how often your emotes are used, run the `/emote stats` command.
It returns the most used emojis in your server, as well as how often they're used.

You can also scroll and see the least used emojis to help decide which ones you might want to remove if you're at the emoji limit.

## Information about a specific emoji

NQN can also bring up information about emojis in your server.
Use the `/emote info` command and select an emoji. 
It'll bring up information such as:
- The emoji ID
- How many uses it's had in the server, or uses per day if large enough
- The total number uses per day, if the emoji (including reuploads) is used often enough in a lot of servers
- Other names the emoji has been uploaded with (once it's had that name enough times)
- Any roles you've locked usage to
- The time of upload
- The URL
- The URL to the static image (only if animated)
