# With a search

You can search for an emote in NQN's database using the `/emote upload from_search` command.

The search functionality supports the following filters:
- `search`: Filter emotes to ones which match your terms.
- `exact`: Shows only the emojis with names that exactly match your search terms.
- `animated`: If set to `True` only show animated emojis. If `False` only static ones. If empty then show all emojis.
- `order`: Order by `relevance` to your search or by `random`.
- `page`: Specifies the start page of your search.
