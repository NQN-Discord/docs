# From a message in your server

If someone posts an emoji in your server that's really cool, you can gain access to it with the `!emote upload` command. 
Simply reply to the message with the emote, and run `!emote upload`.
The bot automatically reads out emojis used in that message, and prompts if you want to upload them.

This works great if you want to allow all your users to be able to use an emoji quickly.
