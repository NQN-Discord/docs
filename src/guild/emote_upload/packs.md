# Saving emotes from packs

If you find a pack you want to save emotes from, use the `/pack save` command, targeting the pack with the emojis you want in your server. 
NQN will respond with a selector for all the emotes in that pack, as well as the option to save all the emotes in that pack. 

Note that NQN will only save emotes up to the emote limit in your server, and there's a global limit for the amount of emotes that can be uploaded in a server per hour across all users. 
If NQN is only able to save a portion of the emotes in the pack, you can run the command again later to re-upload the remaining emotes.
