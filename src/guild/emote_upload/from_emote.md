# From an alias or mutual server

The `/emote upload from_emote` command supports any emoji you can get from NQN. 
It supports the following sources of emojis:
- Aliases
- Your packs
- Your mutual servers with the bot
- Recently used emojis in your server
- Any server aliases or packs you're subscribed to

You don't have to remember the exact name of the emote with this command, as it's got autocompletion enabled.
