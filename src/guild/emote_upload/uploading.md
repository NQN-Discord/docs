# Adding Emojis

NQN provides several methods of uploading emojis depending on how you're searching for them.

- If you're looking for emojis based on their name, [`/emote upload from_search`](search.md) is what you need.
- If you're wanting to re-upload an emoji from a shared server you have with NQN, try [`/emote upload from_emote`](from_emote.md).
- Likewise, if it's from an alias, use [`/emote upload from_emote`](from_emote.md).
- When you want to upload emotes with a theme, try using `/pack search` and once you've found a pack, use [`/pack save`](packs.md) to upload it's emotes to your server.
- If you want to upload an emote that's been used in a message in your server, 'reply' to it with the command [`!upload_emote`](from_message.md).
- If you have a file on your phone and want to upload it quickly, use `/emote upload from_attachment`.
- If you want to re-upload a sticker as an emote, send it with the `!emote upload` command.
