# Using animated emojis through the Discord Client

Normally when using NQN, you need to remember the name of the emote you want to use and send it within `:colons:`.
As a server moderator, you're able to make this process easier for animated emojis in your own server with the `/server link` command. 

When you run it, select an animated emoji in your server, and NQN uploads a static version which anybody can use without Nitro. 
NQN then detects use of that emoji and automatically replaces it with the animated version. 

*Note: Do not remove the number NQN adds to the end of the uploaded emoji's name.*
