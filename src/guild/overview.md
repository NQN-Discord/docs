# For server administrators

NQN provides sensible defaults for its configuration out of the box.

However, the following are things you as an admin might want to consider deciding are what's right for you:

- Ensure NQN has the right [permissions](./permissions.md)
- NQN has the ability to expand message links to show their content.
    - *View the [settings](./settings.md) page for more information*
- Decide if you want NQN to leave 'ghost pings' behind, or if your members would prefer to see the messages they're pinged in.
    - *View the [settings](./settings.md) page for more information*
