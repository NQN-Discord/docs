# Packs

Packs are collections of emojis that have been uploaded to a server and then published through the `/pack publish` command.
All the emojis that have been uploaded in the server are included in the pack of that server if it is published. 
The same way as aliases belong to users, only the user that joins a pack can then use it. 
For more information regarding how to name server wide packs refer to [adding emojis through packs and aliases](../guild/emote_upload/adding.md).



Users can join a pack to gain access to all the emojis of it through the command `/pack join`, 
as well as search for new packs through `/pack search`. 
If a user wishes to leave a pack, he can do so through the `/pack leave` command or through the leave pack button in the `/pack mine` command.

A full list of all the packs you have joined can be seen through the `/pack mine` or `/pack dm` commands.
