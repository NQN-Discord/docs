# Packs

Packs are collections of emojis that have been uploaded to a server and then published through the `/pack publish` command.
All the emojis that have been uploaded to a server are included in the pack.
Like aliases, you can only use emotes from a pack you've explicitly joined.
[Guide for administrating your server's packs](../guild/emote_access/packs.md).



To gain access to all the emojis in a pack use `/pack join`. 
You can find new packs with `/pack search`. 
If you want to leave a pack, you can do it with the `/pack leave` command or through the leave pack button on the `/pack mine` command.

A full list of all the packs you have joined can be seen through the `/pack mine` or `/pack dm` commands.
