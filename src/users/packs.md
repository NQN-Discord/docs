# Packs

Packs are collections of emojis that have been uploaded to a server and then made available through the `/pack publish` command.
All the emojis that have been uploaded to a server are included in the pack.
Joining a pack allows you to use all the emojis that pack contains.



To gain access to all the emojis in a pack use `/pack join`. 
You can find new packs with `/pack search`.
For example, if you want to find packs with a certain theme, such as Pepe emotes, then using `/pack search pepe` will show a list of all the packs containing emotes with `pepe` in the emote name.
If you want to leave a pack, you can do it with the `/pack leave` command or through the leave pack button on the `/pack mine` command.

A full list of all the packs you have joined can be seen through the `/pack mine` or `/pack dm` commands.
