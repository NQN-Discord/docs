# Your Emojis

There are 4 different sources from which you can use emojis through the bot:

- Common Server Emojis
- Server Cached Emojis
- [Aliases](aliases.md)
- [Packs](packs.md)

In this section we'll explain the first two sources while you can learn more about the other two in their respective sections.

## Common Server Emojis

The first source of emojis are the Common Server Emojis.
These are the emojis that have been directly uploaded onto discord servers where both you and the bot are.
This emulates the behaviour of nitro closely as we can see in the following example:

> An emoji named `:nqn:` has been uploaded to server A.
Both you and the bot are in this server.
This allows you to use the emojis of server A on all the servers you share with the bot.

You can see all the emotes you can use through the command `/my_emotes`

## Server Cached Emojis

The second source of emojis are Server Cached Emojis. 
The bot caches emojis in different situations in order to allow users access to them. 

The cached emojis are as follows:

- Recently used emojis in the server
- Recently shown packs in the server

They can only be used in the same server for 24 hours after the previous use.
